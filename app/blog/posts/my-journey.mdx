Over the past four years, I've been learning how to build full, interactive and modern web applications using regular CSS and Node.js. I started with regular CSS and then moved on to popular frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). If you're familiar with these frameworks, you'll know how tricky it can be to debug your codebase.

## The philosophy behind Yumma CSS

[Yumma CSS](https://www.yummacss.com/) makes it much easier to write CSS. It does this by making the CSS as short as possible, while keeping the meaning the same by using abbreviated syntax.

## How does Yumma CSS compare to other Framrworks?

Every Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS project I worked on ended up with far too many selectors in my markups. I got to a point where I was bored with that approach.

## Centering using Flexbox

Let's see how centring with Flexbox fares in these frameworks:

### Bootstrap

```html
<div class="align-items-center d-flex justify-content-center">...</div>
```

### Tailwind CSS

```html
<div class="items-center flex justify-center">...</div>
```

## Yumma CSS

```html
<div class="ai-c d-f jc-c">...</div>
```

## Main concepts

If you're looking to integrate Yumma CSS into a new or existing project, here are a few [key concepts](https://www.yummacss.com/docs/installation#concepts) to keep in mind before making the switch from Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
