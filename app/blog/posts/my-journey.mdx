I've been learning and experimenting with a lot of web technologies, and I've decided to focus on web apps. I started with Bootstrap and then slowly started using Tailwind CSS. I really liked both, but there was one problem: the amount of lines of code. Since the end of 2023, I've decided to create my own CSS library called Yumma CSS, just for fun. It promises to create web pages without compromising on large code sizes in the markup.

## Small and concise class names

The main difference between Tailwind CSS and Yumma CSS is in how they handle class names. Tailwind's class names are pretty straightforward, but I thought we could make the CSS writing process even simpler by making them as short as possible while keeping their meaning.


### Tailwind CSS

```html
<!-- Center content using flexbox -->
<div class="items-center flex justify-center">...</div>
```

## Yumma CSS

```html
<!-- Center content using flexbox -->
<div class="ai-c d-f jc-c">...</div>
```

There is more I want o talk about Yumma CSS

## Conclusion

I will keep developing this blog...
