Over the past four years, I've been learning how to build full, interactive and modern web applications using regular CSS and Node.js. I started with regular CSS and then moved on to popular frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). If you're familiar with these frameworks, you'll know how tricky it can be to debug your codebase.

## The philosophy behind Yumma CSS

[Yumma CSS](https://www.yummacss.com/) makes it much easier to write CSS. It does this by making the CSS as short as possible, while keeping the meaning the same by using abbreviated syntax.

## How does Yumma CSS compare to other Frameworks?

Every Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS project I worked on ended up with far too many selectors in my markups. I got to a point where I was bored with that approach.

## Centering using Flexbox

Let's see how centering with Flex box fares in these frameworks:

**Using Bootstrap**

```html
<div class="align-items-center d-flex justify-content-center">...</div>
```

**Using Tailwind CSS**

```html
<div class="items-center flex jc-c">...</div>
```

**Using Yumma CSS**

```html
<div class="ai-c d-f jc-c">...</div>
```

## Migration guide

If you're already using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS and want to give [Yumma CSS](https://www.yummacss.com/) a try, I've put together a [migration guide](/) to help you make the switch without any hiccups. It covers everything from converting classes to tweaking your build process.

## Maintainability and scalability

When you're working on big projects, it's really important to keep your code clean and easy to manage. [Yumma CSS](https://www.yummacss.com/) is scalable and has an official set of UI components, making it a solid choice for projects using frameworks like React or Vue. The modular nature of [Yumma CSS](https://www.yummacss.com/) helps keep your styles organized and easy to maintain.
